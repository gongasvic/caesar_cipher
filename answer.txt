Gallic tribe has roughly around 1000 soldiers, but Iâ€™m not really sure of the exact number. I saw their parade and here is what happened. when they were lining up in rows of 11, I counted that the final "remainder" row has 9 soldiers. When they were lining up in rows of 13, I figured that the final "remainder" row has 1 soldier and when they lined up in rows of 17, there were 14 soldiers in the final "remainder" row.
